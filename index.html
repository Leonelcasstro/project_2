    <div class="body-right">Ligatures are special characters that combine two or more letters into a single glyph for aesthetic or readability reasons. They're often used to prevent awkward spacing or collisions between certain letter combinations.
diacritics: Diacritics are marks added to letters to alter their pronunciation or to distinguish between different sounds or meanings. Examples include accents (e.g., á, è, ü), umlauts (e.g., ö, ï), and cedillas (e.g., ç).
punctuation: Punctuation marks such as em dashes (—), en dashes (–), ellipses (…), and various quotation marks (‘ ’ “ ”) are essential special characters that add clarity and style to text.
currency symbols: Symbols like the dollar ($), euro (€), pound (£), and yen (¥) are often included in typefaces to support multi-lingual and multi-currency usage.
mathematical symbols: Freight may include a range of mathematical symbols such as plus (+), minus (−), multiplication (×), division (÷), and various mathematical operators for use in equations and formulas.
ornamental characters: These decorative characters add flair to a design. They can include swashes, flourishes, ornaments, and other embellishments.
icons and pictograms: Depending on the specific variant of Freight, there may be a set of icons or pictograms included for use in design projects, signage, or digital interfaces.
